**Background:** Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material. Such sentiment analysis from text sources like reviews, tweets etc. can give us important and interesting insights about what people are talking about, the sentiments of people, their opinions towards a particular topic/brand and the general trends in society.

**Context:** This project is a sentiment analysis ML project on Amazon Kindle book reviews. The source for these reviews is a massive data repository that contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014.

Our goal from this project is to extract insights from these reviews, which are a rich source of data, in order to better understand current climate within the book industry and see what types of books are highly consumed. The relevance of this project, for businesses and individuals alike, cannot be denied. Individuals can use results from this analysis to further enrich their book collection with books that the majority love. If public sentiment towards a book is not so good, they may also decide to avoid such books. Additionally, local bookstores and vendors can use such analysis to understand general demand and offer good products. Thus, sentiment analysis can help people in their decision-making process. 

**Task:** To train a **Binary Classification Model** to predict whether an Amazon Kindle book review is positive or non-positive based on the contents of the review. Each row in the data is an instance of a person's review related to a book.
